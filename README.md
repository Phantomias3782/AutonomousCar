# Project SELMA - SELbstfahrendes Modell Auto

![SELMA](advertising/SELMA_Testfahrt.gif)

The project was created in connection with the integration seminar in the Data Science course at the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Mannheim. An extended documentation is stored as a scientific elaboration as PDF.

## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Install all dependencys

Therefore simply run the [install.sh](install.sh)
This will install all needed libaries, that can be found in [dependencies.txt](dependencies.txt) and [apt.txt](apt.txt).

### Step 2 - Install the pi to the car

Therefore you need to connect the camera to the pi and change the wiring harness of the car as shown below:

### Step 3 - Run the car

Now you can use the [run_car.py](./main/run_car.py) or [main.py](./main/main.py) script to either just controll the car or also see the detection in the local network via localhost:5000/.
